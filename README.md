### DPS907 and WSA500 for the Fall 2014 semester

**Code examples**

Organized by week. Each "week" page has a read me file that describes the example.  

You can browse the code online. 

You can also pull the repository to your own computer (clone or download).  

**How to use "Download ZIP"**

Download to a folder. Unzip.  

Notice the "packages" folder in the 'root'. Also notice that each code example folder does NOT include a "packages" folder.  Why? To reduce the download size. 

Before opening a code example, copy the "packages" folder into its folder.  

*Problems?* Please contact your professor for help.
