### Week 2 code examples

**ColourList**

Gentle introduction to web services.  
Uses your previous knowledge and experience with ASP.NET MVC web apps.  
The data entity is a simple collection of "Colour" objects.  
The objects are persisted in a data store. Entity Framework is used; SQL Server is the store technology.  

This example implements 'get all', 'get one', and 'add new' use cases.
